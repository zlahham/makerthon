#Makers Academy Makerthon Project
---
Makerthon is a two day event taking place in week 9 of the course.
It resembles a hackathon, but has one exception - all code is properly tested
and well crafted. The event kicked off with project pitches, voting, and
team selection.

##Pllr - Your Real-time Engagement Tool
Our project is Pllr, /ˈpəʊlə/, a real time voting system that
records up votes and down votes, and draws a graph based on the results.
